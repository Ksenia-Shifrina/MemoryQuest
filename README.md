# Memory Quest

**Memory Quest** is a memory game website built with **React** and **TypeScript**, featuring dynamic animations and a variety of engaging game modes. The website includes smooth animations, card flips and rotations, and a custom navigation bar with page transitions. The game offers multiple difficulty levels and even multiplayer functionality for an enhanced user experience.

This project combines frontend development with interactive animations to create a visually appealing and fun memory game. It was designed and developed as part of a personal journey to enhance my skills in **React**, **TypeScript**, and **UI/UX design**. By implementing challenging features such as dynamic animations and a rotating dashboard, I was able to bring my vision to life while improving my front-end development abilities.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Animations**: Cards flip and rotate during the game, while the navigation bar and page transitions provide smooth visual effects.
- **Custom UI**: The user interface was designed in **Figma** before implementation, ensuring a clear and consistent layout.
- **Multiple Game Modes**: Various difficulty levels with different challenges to suit different types of players.
- **Multiplayer Functionality**: Play the game with friends in multiplayer mode.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Material UI**
- **CSS3 (Keyframes, Flexbox)**
- **npm Packages**:
  - Confetti Animation

## Learning Highlights

- **Smooth Animations and Transitions**: Learned to work with **CSS keyframes** to implement dynamic animations, such as rotating elements and smooth page transitions.
- **Responsive Layouts**: Worked with **Flexbox** to ensure the application layout is flexible and responsive across various screen sizes.
- **Custom Components**: Focused on building **reusable React components** that are modular, scalable, and maintainable.
- **Creative Problem-Solving**: Tackled challenges like smoothing button rotations by tracking angles and creating dynamic animation keyframes.
- **npm Package Exploration**: Experimented with and customised various npm packages to implement flipping card animations and confetti effects.

## Future Improvements

- Create three more memory games.
- Add authentication and authorisation to track user progress.
- Implement a leaderboard to track high scores.
